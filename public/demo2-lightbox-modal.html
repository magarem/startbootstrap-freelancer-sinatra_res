<div class="modal-body"
    ng-swipe-left="Lightbox.nextImage()"
    ng-swipe-right="Lightbox.prevImage()">

  <!-- image -->
  <div class="lightbox-image-container">
    <img lightbox-src="{{Lightbox.imageUrl}}">
  </div>

  <!-- caption -->
  <div class="alert alert-info" style="margin: 1em 0 0;">
    The color in the image is <strong>{{Lightbox.imageCaption}}</strong>.<br>
    This is a custom template where we've removed the top nav and added a Bootstrap alert box. It makes the modal taller and so we have changed its height calculation.<br>
    Also, the maximum display height of the image has been increased to 1600 (instead of being dependent on the window height), thus vertical scrolling is now possible.
